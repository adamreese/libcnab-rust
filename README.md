# libcnab: CNAB library for Rust

This is a highly experimental (and currently unfinished) implementation of CNAB Core 1.0.
It is written in Rust.

Progress:

- [x] implement `bundle.json` structs
- [ ] test deserialize
- [ ] write Canonical JSON
- [ ] read/write `bundle.json` from files and strings
- [ ] execute a bundle in Docker
- [ ] support custom actions

We're just learning Rust, so we welcome feedback and PRs.
